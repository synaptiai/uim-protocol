# UIM Protocol Implementation Guides

Welcome to the UIM Protocol Implementation Guides. This section provides practical guidance for implementing the UIM Protocol in your applications, whether you're developing an AI agent or a web service.

## Available Guides

- [Getting Started](getting-started.md): A quick introduction to the UIM Protocol and how to get started with implementation
- [AI Agent Guide](ai-agent-guide.md): Detailed guide for implementing the UIM Protocol in AI agents
- [Service Provider Guide](service-provider-guide.md): Comprehensive guide for web service providers implementing the UIM Protocol
- [Integration Examples](integration-examples.md): Real-world examples of UIM Protocol integration

## Implementation Approach

When implementing the UIM Protocol, we recommend the following approach:

1. **Understand the Core Concepts**: Familiarize yourself with the core concepts of the UIM Protocol, including intents, metadata, and the execute method.
2. **Choose an Architecture**: Decide which architecture (centralized, decentralized, or hybrid) best suits your needs.
3. **Implement Core Components**: Implement the core components of the protocol, including discovery mechanisms, policy management, and intent execution.
4. **Test and Validate**: Test your implementation against the validation suite to ensure compliance with the specification.
5. **Deploy and Monitor**: Deploy your implementation and monitor its performance and security.

## Implementation Checklist
