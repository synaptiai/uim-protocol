# Architecture

The UIM Protocol supports three architectural models for implementing the interaction between AI agents and web services: Centralized, Decentralized, and Hybrid. Each model has its own advantages, trade-offs, and use cases. This section provides a detailed explanation of each architecture model.

## 1. Centralized Architecture

The Centralized Architecture, also known as the Man-in-the-Middle Approach, serves as an intermediary system that manages all interactions between AI agents and web services. This model centralizes the registration, discovery, execution, and policy management of intents, offering a streamlined and unified platform that simplifies integrations and ensures consistency across all interactions.

### 1.1 Key Components

1. **Central Repository**:
   - Acts as the main hub for all intent data, storing information from multiple web services in a single, accessible location
   - Ensures that AI agents have a streamlined path to discovering and executing intents

2. **Service Management APIs**:
   - Facilitate the registration, updating, and removal of intents by web services
   - Ensure that the central repository always contains current data

3. **Discovery and Execution APIs**:
   - Enable AI agents to find available intents and perform actions based on the information in the central repository
   - Standardize the interaction process, making it easy for AI agents to access a wide range of services through a single interface

4. **Centralized PAT Management**:
   - Manages the issuance, validation, and enforcement of Policy Adherence Tokens
   - Ensures secure and compliant interactions between AI agents and web services

### 1.2 Workflow

1. **Service Registration**:
   - Web services submit their available intents, including descriptions, parameters, and execution details, to the central repository through the Service Management APIs
   - Web services can update, modify, or remove their intents via the same management APIs

2. **Intent Discovery**:
   - AI agents query the central repository's Discovery APIs to search for available intents based on their needs
   - The central system handles all requests and responses, reducing the need for AI agents to interact directly with each individual web service

3. **Policy Adherence and Security**:
   - The central system issues PATs to AI agents after verifying compliance with the service's policies
   - These tokens encapsulate permissions, usage limits, and billing agreements, ensuring that only authorized interactions occur

4. **Execution of Intents**:
   - Once an intent is discovered, the AI agent uses the Execution APIs provided by the central repository to perform the desired actions
   - The central system coordinates the request, forwards it to the appropriate web service, and manages the execution flow

5. **Error Handling and Adaptation**:
   - The central system provides standardized error codes and recovery protocols
   - If an intent fails to execute, the central system can offer alternative intents or suggest retries

### 1.3 Advantages

- **Unified Management**: A single repository controls the discovery and execution of intents, providing a consistent interface for AI agents and web services
- **Streamlined Compliance**: Centralized management of Policy Adherence Tokens (PATs) ensures uniform application of security and billing rules
- **Simplified Integration**: Web services register their intents once with the central system, making them easily discoverable by AI agents without the need for multiple, separate integrations
- **Standardized Data**: Consistent intent formats and metadata facilitate easier integration and use by AI agents
- **Enhanced Security**: Centralized control over access, authentication, and rate limiting helps enforce security and compliance measures
- **Reliable Monetization**: A clear, controlled pathway for monetization, allowing the central system to manage payments and enforce billing policies

### 1.4 Disadvantages

- **Single Point of Failure**: If the central repository encounters issues, all interactions are affected, posing a risk to system reliability
- **Scalability Concerns**: As the number of web services and AI agents grows, the central system may struggle to manage high volumes of requests efficiently
- **Limited Autonomy**: Web services must adhere to the central repository's rules and policies, limiting their autonomy and control over interactions
- **Higher Onboarding Complexity for Web Services**: Web services must integrate with the central repository, which may require additional development and maintenance resources
- **Data Privacy**: Centralized storage of intent data can raise concerns about data ownership, security, and privacy

### 1.5 Use Cases

- **Financial Services**: Ideal for industries requiring strict compliance and security, such as banking, where a unified approach simplifies oversight and reduces risks
- **E-commerce Platforms**: Provides a standardized method for product searches, inventory management, and automated transactions
- **Customer Service Automation**: Streamlines the integration of multiple support services, allowing AI agents to access a broad range of helpdesk intents from a single point of contact

## 2. Decentralized Architecture

The Decentralized Architecture empowers AI agents to autonomously discover, interact with, and execute actions on web services without relying on a centralized intermediary. Each web service independently manages its own intents, publishing relevant information through DNS TXT records and `agents.json` files.

![Decentralized Architecture](../assets/images/decentral-arch.png)

### 2.1 Key Components

1. **DNS TXT Records and `agents.json` Files**:
   - Serve as self-publishing mechanisms for web services to expose information about their intents, discovery endpoints, security protocols, and rate limits
   - Web services include specific DNS TXT records that link to the `agents.json` file

2. **Intent Discovery APIs**:
   - Hosted by individual web services and provide AI agents with a way to query and retrieve intent data
   - Each service can customize its discovery API, offering intents tailored to its capabilities and user needs

3. **Decentralized PAT Management**:
   - Each service issues its own tokens based on predefined policies, giving them control over who can execute their intents
   - AI agents must request PATs by contacting the policy endpoint outlined in the `agents.json` file

### 2.2 Workflow

1. **Crawling and Discovery**:
   - Each web service publishes information about its available intents, discovery endpoints, and policy adherence requirements using DNS TXT records and `agents.json` files
   - AI agents autonomously crawl these records to identify discovery endpoints and other relevant details

2. **Intent Retrieval**:
   - Once the AI agent has identified a discovery endpoint from the `agents.json` file, it queries the endpoint to retrieve the list of available intents
   - The AI agent collects information about each intent, including required parameters, expected responses, rate limits, and any associated costs

3. **Policy Adherence and Security**:
   - Each web service manages its own Policy Adherence Tokens (PATs), which are issued to AI agents based on their compliance with specified policies
   - AI agents must request a PAT from the web service's policy endpoint, specifying the intents they intend to use and adhering to the service's access rules

4. **Execution of Intents**:
   - With the required PAT and intent information, AI agents send execution requests directly to the web service's endpoint
   - The web service processes the request, validates the PAT, and returns the desired results or actions

5. **Error Handling and Adaptation**:
   - If an intent is unavailable or a service denies a request, AI agents can dynamically adapt by querying other available services or adjusting their parameters

### 2.3 Advantages

- **Direct Interaction**: AI agents interact directly with web services, discovering and executing intents without the need for a central repository
- **Scalability and Resilience**: By distributing the workload across individual web services, the architecture naturally scales to accommodate large numbers of interactions, reducing the risk of a single point of failure
- **Privacy and Autonomy**: Web services retain control over their data and interaction policies, enhancing privacy and allowing for more customized interactions
- **Flexibility and Adaptability**: AI agents can quickly adapt to changes in web services without waiting for updates in a central repository

### 2.4 Disadvantages

- **Consistency Challenges**: Each service manages its own rules and data, which can lead to inconsistencies in how intents are defined and executed
- **Higher Onboarding Complexity for AI Agents**: Requires agents to handle diverse sets of discovery and policy adherence rules, increasing the complexity of initial setup and maintenance
- **Potential Data Silos**: Since each service manages its own execution and PAT system, data generated from interactions can become siloed, making it harder to gather comprehensive analytics across the ecosystem

### 2.5 Use Cases

- **Privacy and Security**: Use cases where maintaining control over data and interactions is critical, such as healthcare, finance, and personal assistants
- **IoT and Smart Environments**: Ideal for managing numerous devices and services in a distributed network where autonomy and direct communication are essential
- **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)**: Facilitates secure, direct interaction with financial services, maintaining privacy and compliance without relying on centralized intermediaries

## 3. Hybrid Approach

The Hybrid Approach combines centralized discovery with decentralized execution and PAT issuance, drawing parallels with how search engines like Google operate. In this model, the centralized discovery system provides AI agents with a standardized and comprehensive way to discover available intents across multiple web services, while the actual execution of intents is handled directly between the AI agents and web services.

![Hybrid Architecture](../assets/images/hybrid-arch.png)

### 3.1 Key Components

1. **Centralized Discovery System**:
   - Aggregates intent information from multiple web services
   - Web services publish their intents using `agents.json` files or register through service management endpoints
   - AI agents query the centralized discovery system to find relevant intents

2. **Decentralized Execution**:
   - After discovering intents, AI agents execute actions directly by interacting with the specific web service's execution endpoints
   - This decentralized execution maintains the service's control over how intents are performed

3. **Decentralized PAT Issuance**:
   - Each web service independently manages its own PAT issuance, ensuring that security, compliance, and billing policies are locally enforced
   - This allows web services to define and enforce their own rules, even as they participate in a broader, centrally-discovered ecosystem

### 3.2 Workflow

1. **Centralized Discovery**:
   - Web services publish their available intents via `agents.json` files hosted on their domains or register them through centralized service management APIs
   - The central discovery system periodically crawls web services, reading `agents.json` files and indexing the intents available
   - AI agents query the central discovery system to find intents relevant to the user's request

2. **Decentralized Execution**:
   - Once an AI agent identifies an appropriate intent, it bypasses the central system and sends execution requests directly to the web service's execution endpoint
   - Each web service independently manages its execution rules, including parameter validation, rate limits, and error handling

3. **Decentralized PAT Issuance**:
   - Web services independently issue and validate PATs, which are required for AI agents to execute intents
   - The PAT encapsulates permissions, usage constraints, and billing terms tailored to each service's policies

### 3.3 Advantages

- **Enhanced Discovery with Local Execution Control**: Centralized discovery simplifies the search process for AI agents, making it easier to find relevant intents across multiple services, while decentralized execution preserves the autonomy of web services
- **Scalable and Resilient**: By decoupling discovery from execution, this approach reduces the processing load on the central system and distributes it across web services, enhancing overall scalability and resilience
- **Flexible Compliance**: Decentralized PAT issuance allows each web service to enforce its own compliance and security protocols, adapting to specific regulatory requirements and minimizing centralized security risks
- **Reduced Latency**: Direct execution between AI agents and web services minimizes latency compared to a fully centralized execution model, improving response times and user experience

### 3.4 Disadvantages

- **Coordination Complexity**: Maintaining consistency between the centralized discovery index and the decentralized execution points can be challenging
- **Diverse Compliance Requirements**: AI agents must navigate varying compliance rules across different services due to decentralized PAT issuance
- **Potential Data Silos**: Since each service manages its own execution and PAT system, data generated from interactions can become siloed
- **Increased Onboarding Complexity for Web Services**: Web services must manage both centralized discovery and decentralized execution, which can increase the complexity of onboarding and maintenance compared to a fully centralized model

### 3.5 Use Cases

- **Enterprise Solutions**: Ideal for enterprise environments where a centralized discovery system can provide a unified view of available services, while individual departments maintain control over their specific services
- **Multi-Cloud Environments**: Facilitates the discovery and execution of services across multiple cloud providers, maintaining the autonomy of each provider while providing a unified discovery experience
- **Marketplace Platforms**: Enables the creation of marketplaces where services can be discovered centrally, but executed directly, allowing for a diverse ecosystem of services with varying compliance and security requirements
