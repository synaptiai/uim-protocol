# UIM Protocol Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the planned development and evolution of the Unified Intent Mediator (UIM) Protocol. It provides a high-level overview of our goals, priorities, and timeline for future releases.

## Current Status

The UIM Protocol is currently in the **Alpha** stage. We are actively developing the core components and gathering feedback from early adopters.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)

**Timeline: Q1-Q2 2025**

The focus of this phase is to establish the core components of the protocol and create initial reference implementations.

**Key Milestones:**
- âœ… Define the core protocol specification
- âœ… Implement basic discovery mechanisms
- âœ… Create reference implementations for AI agents and web services
- âœ… Establish documentation and community guidelines
- ðŸ”„ Gather feedback from early adopters
- ðŸ”„ Refine the protocol based on initial feedback

### Phase 2: Expansion

**Timeline: Q3-Q4 2025**

In this phase, we will expand the protocol's capabilities and improve its robustness.

**Key Milestones:**
- ðŸ“‹ Enhance security features
- ðŸ“‹ Implement advanced policy mechanisms
- ðŸ“‹ Develop tools for protocol compliance testing
- ðŸ“‹ Create SDKs for popular programming languages

### Phase 3: Standardization

**Timeline: Q1-Q2 2026**

This phase focuses on standardization and wider adoption.

**Key Milestones:**
- ðŸ“‹ Submit the protocol for standardization
- ðŸ“‹ Develop enterprise-grade features
- ðŸ“‹ Create a marketplace for UIM-compatible services
- ðŸ“‹ Implement advanced analytics and monitoring
- ðŸ“‹ Establish a governance model for long-term sustainability
- ðŸ“‹ Expand to additional platforms and environments

### Phase 4: Ecosystem Growth

**Timeline: Q3-Q4 2026 and beyond**

The final phase focuses on growing the ecosystem and ensuring long-term sustainability.

**Key Milestones:**
- ðŸ“‹ Foster a vibrant community of developers and users
- ðŸ“‹ Support integration with emerging technologies
- ðŸ“‹ Develop specialized extensions for different industries
- ðŸ“‹ Establish partnerships with major platforms and services
- ðŸ“‹ Create educational resources and certification programs
- ðŸ“‹ Ensure backward compatibility and sustainable evolution
