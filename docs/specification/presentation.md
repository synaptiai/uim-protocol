## Presentation Notes

This presentation is designed to be delivered in approximately 60-90 minutes, with time for Q&A at the end. Key points to emphasize:

1. The pressing need for standardization in AI-service interactions
2. How UIM addresses current challenges
3. The flexibility of the protocol's architecture
4. Real-world benefits and implementation examples
5. The ease of getting started and community support

Visual elements (diagrams, charts, etc.) should be created to be clear and engaging, using a consistent style throughout the presentation. The speaker should be prepared to dive deeper into technical details during the Q&A session.
