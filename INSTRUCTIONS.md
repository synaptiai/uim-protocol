# Instructions for Using CRCT v7.0

These instructions assume youâ€™re using the Cline VS Code extension with CRCT v7.0. The system automates most tasks via the LLM, but some manual steps are needed to get started.

---

## Prerequisites

- **VS Code**: Installed with the Cline extension.
- **Python**: 3.8+ with `pip`.
- **Git**: To clone the repo.

---

## Step 1: Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RPG-fan/Cline-Recursive-Chain-of-Thought-System-CRCT-.git
   cd Cline-Recursive-Chain-of-Thought-System-CRCT-
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *Includes `sentence-transformers` for embeddings.*

3. **Open in VS Code**:
   - Launch VS Code and open the `cline/` folder.

4. **Configure Cline**:
   - Open the Cline extension settings.
   - Paste the contents of `cline_docs/prompts/core_prompt(put this in Custom Instructions).md` into the system prompt field.

---

## Step 2: Initialize the System

1. **Start the LLM**:
   - In the Cline input, type `Start.` and run it.
   - The LLM will:
     - Read `.clinerules` (or create it if missing).
     - Load the `Set-up/Maintenance` plugin.
     - Initialize core files in `cline_docs/`.

2. **Follow Prompts**:
   - The LLM may ask for input (e.g., project goals for `projectbrief.md`).
   - Provide concise answers to help it populate files.

3. **Verify Setup**:
   - Check `cline_docs/` for new files (e.g., `dependency_tracker.md`).
   - Ensure `[CODE_ROOT_DIRECTORIES]` in `.clinerules` lists `src/` (edit manually if needed).

---

## Step 3: Populate Dependency Trackers

1. **Run Initial Setup**:
   - Input: `Perform initial setup and populate dependency trackers.`
   - The LLM will:
     - Identify code roots (e.g., `src/`).
     - Generate `dependency_tracker.md` and `doc_tracker.md` using `dependency_processor.py`.
     - Suggest and validate dependencies.

2. **Manual Validation (if prompted)**:
   - The LLM may present dependency suggestions (e.g., JSON output).
   - Confirm or adjust characters (`<`, `>`, `x`, etc.) as prompted.

---

## Step 4: Plan and Execute

1. **Enter Strategy Phase**:
   - Once trackers are populated, the LLM will transition to `Strategy` (check `.clinerules`).
   - Input: `Plan the next steps for my project.`
   - Output: New instruction files in `strategy_tasks/` or `src/`.

2. **Execute Tasks**:
   - Input: `Execute the planned tasks.`
   - The LLM will follow instruction files, update files, and apply the MUP.

---

## Tips

- **Monitor `activeContext.md`**: Tracks current state and priorities.
- **Check `.clinerules`**: Shows the current phase and next action.
- **Debugging**: If stuck, try `Review the current state and suggest next steps.`

---

## Notes

- CRCT v7.0 is a work-in-progress. Expect minor bugs (e.g., tracker initialization).
- The LLM handles most commands (`generate-keys`, `set_char`, etc.) automatically.
- For custom projects, populate `src/` and `docs/` before starting.
